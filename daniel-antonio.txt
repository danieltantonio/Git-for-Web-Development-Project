Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
      - Inline elements use up as much space within a line as possible before breaking into another line of space.
      - Block elements take up the whole line of space for itself.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
      - The element will stay relative to where it was originally located but the elements around it will act as though nothing is there.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
      - display: inline-block;
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
      - block: <p>, <div>, <nav>
      - inline: <a>, <img>
      - inline-block: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
      - Almost every HTML element is considered a box. And each box has layers starting with the content.
        The layers go from inwards to outwards as followed:
        -- Content (your picture, text, textbox, etc. The centered box.)
        -- Padding (the space between your content and the border. The box just outside of your content.)
        -- Border (the outline of your content. The third layer of the box.)
        -- Margin (the space outwards of your content, padding, and border. The last box.)
      - The "border-box" method is considered to be the "fix" to the box model for CSS. The reason why is because let's say you have some content that you've set a
        width of 200px to, but you also want to add some padding of 50px and a border of 5px. Unfortunately it would add some extra spacing to the width because of
        the padding and border, thus making it look as if it is 255px even though it is not. The border-box method lets you add padding and a border without messing up
        the set width.
